## Pro Tips for Recording

- **Mouse speed**: Move slowly and deliberately. Fast cursor movements look amateur.
- **Pauses**: Pause 1-2 seconds on each important element before moving on.
- **Hover effects**: Hover over cards and buttons to show animations — judges notice polish.
- **Clean browser**: Hide bookmarks bar, close other tabs, use a clean profile.
- **Resolution**: Record at 1080p minimum. 4K if possible.
- **Music**: Add subtle background music in post-production (royalty-free lo-fi or ambient).
- **Transitions**: Simple crossfades between scenes. No fancy effects needed.
- **Text overlays**: Add feature names as text overlays during each scene (e.g., "Token Creator", "Fair Presale").
